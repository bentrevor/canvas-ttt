There are a limited number of possible tic-tac-toe games, so it is relatively simple to hardcode the entire tree of optimal moves.  I didn't know if that could be considered "AI", so I tried to develop a general set of rules so the Computer could decide on a move based on the conditions of the board rather than following a set of explicitly prescribed moves.

In order to keep the AI as simple as possible, I made it just avoid losing rather than trying to play the "best" move.  The only way to win is to set up a situation where you have two winning moves (we'll call it a "fork"), so to avoid losing, the Computer just has to prevent the Human from setting up a fork.  It turned out that two moves is enough to guarantee that you won't lose a game, so for every move after the first two, all the Computer has to do is win or block, if possible.

This is how I numbered the board:

    0 1 2
    7 8 3
    6 5 4

This was the convenient for two reasons.  A few times, the Computer has to decide to move relative to the Human's last move, and this numbering scheme makes that easy.  I also took advantage of the fact that all the edge positions are odd and all the corners are even.  The only downside is that it made the code to get the cursor position and to draw X's and O's a little ugly.


### Strategy

So all the Computer has to do is prevent the Human from setting up a fork, which actually made any of the Computer's turns pretty simple.  It has three priorities in a turn:

1. win (successfully avoid losing the game)
2. block the Human from winning (successfully avoid losing on that turn)
3. prevent the Human from setting up a fork

So the first step of any turn is to always try the first two using a function called `win_or_block()`.  If it can't do either of those things, it's next highest priority is to avoid letting the Human set up a fork.  There's a very limited number of ways a fork can be set up, so this turned out to be pretty simple.

The Computer needs a default move to fall back on if it has nowhere to win or block.  I arbitrarily decided it would be the lowest available position on the board, which turned out to be pretty effective in preventing most forks.  This default move is where the AI can be "improved" so it tries to set up a fork for itself, but it would complicate the AI significantly, and it is always preventable by an intelligent Human opponent anyway.  To implement this, you would need to simulate every possible way to finish the game, and see if there is a move that guarantees victory.  So my AI just tries to not lose.

With the win/block/default rule, it ended up being really simple to prevent most forks.  In general, it is easier to prevent the Human from setting up a fork if the Computer has the center, so it always moves there if it can.  There are a few sequences of moves that can take advantage of the default move, so there are a few cases when the Computer's default move has to be changed.


##### Computer plays first

When the Computer moves to the center first, there is a simple set of rules to never lose.  Thanks to the symmetry of the board, the Human only has the option of moving to a corner or an edge.  When the Human plays an edge as their first move, there is an easy strategy for the Computer to always set up a fork, which is to play a non-adjacent corner:

    _|_|_       O|_|_       O|_|_
    _|O|_  -->  _|O|_  -->  _|O|_
     |X|         |X|X       O|X|X


So this is just a matter of playing 3 positions away from the Human's last move, which was easy because of the way the positions are numbered.  If the Human plays a corner first, there is a sequence of moves that gives it a fork:

    X|_|_        X|O|_        X|O|O
    _|O|_  -->   _|O|_  -->   _|O|_
     | |          |X|         X|X| 


Since that is the only series of moves that sets up a fork for the Human, the Computer just has to avoid playing an edge next to the corner that the Human played in.  Conveniently, playing 3 positions away from the Human's last move satisfies this, so the rules are simple to prevent the computer from ever losing if it moves first:

1. Move to the center
2. Move 3 positions away from the Human's move  
and for the rest of the moves:
3. Try to win
4. Try to block
5. Move to the lowest open position

##### Human plays first

When the Human moved first, it was a little trickier to prevent forks, but the win/block/default rule still covered most positions.  Again, the Computer tries to play the center as its first move, but the Human may already have moved there.  If that is the case, there is a relatively simple set of rules to follow.  The computer is prone to the same fork described above, so it's first move has to be in a corner, which the default rule sets to the top left (position 0).

The win/block/default rule forces a tie for every move the Human can make except for the opposite corner (4):

    O|_|_       O|O|_       O|O|X
    _|X|_  -->  _|X|_  -->  _|X|_
     | |         | |X        | |X
 

To prevent this fork, the Computer just needs to move to another one of the corners.

The only other cases I had to cover were if the Human's first move was to a corner or an edge.  If the Human's two first moves need to be blocked, then the game ends in a series of forced blocks where setting up a fork is impossible.  This left four combinations for the Human to win:

    _|_|X
    _|O|_
    X| | 
 
    _|X|_
    _|O|_
    X| |
 
    _|_|_
    _|O|X
     |X| 
 
    _|X|_
    _|O|_
     |X|

There's no way the last one can make a fork, so we don't need to worry about it.  For the third one, the Human can only make a fork if it plays in the corner between his first two moves.  So for the computer's second move, if both moves are on an edge (i.e. both moves are odd), the computer should play the average of them.

The other two patterns can set up forks:

    _|_|X        O|_|X
    _|O|_  -->   _|O|_
    X| |         X| |X
 
    _|_|_        O| |_
    _|O|X  -->   _|O|X
    X| |         X| |X


So I had to check each orientation of these patterns to see which ones led to the Human winning.  The first case (both of the Human's moves are even) is easily solved by taking any edge position.

When the Human moves to a corner and a non-adjacent edge, there are a few orientations that can set up a fork.  In order to prevent this, the Computer just needs to move "between" the Human's moves.  They are 3 positions away in one direction and 5 positions away in the other, so the Computer needs to move in the smaller gap to prevent the Human from setting up a fork.
